Shared Memory Logging in xv6

This project extends the xv6 operating system with page-based shared memory between processes and a multi-process logging system using atomic operations.

Features:
- Kernel support for mapping shared physical pages between processes
- Custom system calls for shared memory management
- Safe multi-process logging using atomic compare-and-swap
- Userspace test programs demonstrating correctness

Technologies:
C, xv6 Operating System, virtual memory, system calls, concurrency

How to run:
make qemu
(run shmem_test and log_test inside xv6)
